# Quantifying-Nostalgia
This project quantifies nostalgia in movie reviews by examining linguistic patterns, time gaps &amp; review ratings. It utilize ML models (TF-IDF with Logistic Regression and SVM) to identify nostalgic reviews, finding that explicit nostalgia is strongly encoded in text, though structural metadata alone is insufficient for reliable prediction.
